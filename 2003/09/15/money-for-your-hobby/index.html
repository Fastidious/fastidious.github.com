      <p>I have seeing an increasing amount of weblogs that are, either running <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/" title="Google AdSense">Google AdSense</a> to make money or asking for donations. Does that works? I mean, does Google AdSense can be enough for someone to actually make a living out if it? And, on a related token, would the amount of &ldquo;donations&rdquo; add up enough to pay the rent? I am curious.</p>
<p>On politics. I am a republican although I am not sure if I will vote like so on the next Presidential elections. I am not liking any of the candidates of the alternatives parties neither. Will see; I am afraid that, regardless whom I will vote for, it will make no difference. That&rsquo;s the way politics are.</p>
<p>To further add to this, already very disorganised entry, I upgraded the <a href="http://www.isc.org/" title="ISC Consortium">DHCP</a> server today. Nice!</p>
