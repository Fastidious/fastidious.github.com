      <p>Well, I thought it will never come. We &mdash; adults &mdash;, sometimes pursuing our dreams of Peterpan&hellip; we think we&rsquo;ll never age. Slowly our skin becomes saggy and wrinkled; we can not see as sharp as before, hence we wear glasses; our hair turn white (for the lucky ones) and falls down (for those unlucky, like me). The rhythm of live goes at a different beat then. You start getting tired easily, things that previously attracted you do not longer do. Ah&hellip; you have, inevitably, aged.</p>
<p>Yes, I just turned 35. With any luck, I am going to start walking down the road now; I have reached the half of my existence. The interesting thing is that I remember my childhood like it was yesterday, and all the good and bad times I went through. Good memory I still have, but for how long?</p>
<p>I am thankful to be around for one more year, I hope and pray I will have many more to come. I have one more incentive to live for, my son, and of course, my family and friends. I need to be around, not for my own enjoyment, but to serve those around me. That&rsquo;s the meaning of life (meaning subject to change, not available with any other offers).</p>
<p>And to &ldquo;celebrate&rdquo; a new year, I will be changing things around, once again. Such changes are, also, getting old. I know. I am not decrepit&hellip; yet.</p>
