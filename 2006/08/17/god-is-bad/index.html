      <p>&ldquo;Papá, if you get close to a shark, what would he do to you?&rdquo; &ndash;Kent asks one day. &ldquo;Well &ndash;I replied&ndash;, if it is hungry he will most likely attack you, try to eat you. If not, he will be scared and swim away. Sharks are by nature afraid of humans and will only come close to them if they are very hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God is bad. Why would he make sharks, if they could hurt us?&rdquo; &ndash;he asks again. &ldquo;Sharks have a very little brain, they can&rsquo;t make a difference from what&rsquo;s right or wrong. They can&rsquo;t think, just like you and me,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;But why God make them like that? <em>Why?</em>&rdquo; &ndash; Silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God is bad!&rdquo;</p>
