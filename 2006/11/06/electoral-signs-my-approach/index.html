      <p>On every single election &ldquo;season&rdquo; I can see a multitude of signs and advertising that often remains until &ldquo;natural decay&rdquo; or the city gets them removed, 6 months &ndash;or more&ndash; after the elections are over. That really makes me mad. I would make it part of the process of being elected: if you win, you cannot take over office until you clean up all your garbage. And if they don&rsquo;t, a hefty fine gets applied, they get ridiculed and their seat is up for claiming.</p>
<p>This mid-term elections I will not only vote for the less liar of the candidates, but for the one that has none or less signs.</p>
