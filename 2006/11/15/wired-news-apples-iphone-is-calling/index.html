 The most likely scenario, as Jupiter analyst Ian Fogg has pointed out, is that the iPhone will be a stand-alone device that will accept a standard SIM card. You&rsquo;ll pop the SIM card out of your current cell phone and plug it into the iPhone. It&rsquo;ll be just like buying an unlocked handset from Asia, except you&rsquo;ll buy it at an Apple store instead of on Craigslist." />

<p>The most likely scenario, as Jupiter analyst Ian Fogg has pointed out, is that the iPhone will be a stand-alone device that will accept a standard SIM card. You&rsquo;ll pop the SIM card out of your current cell phone and plug it into the iPhone. It&rsquo;ll be just like buying an unlocked handset from Asia, except you&rsquo;ll buy it at an Apple store instead of on Craigslist.</p>
<p>An iPhone with no provider strings attached would be better for the online iTunes store than selling tunes over the airwaves, as some cell companies are trying to do.</p>
<p>As Fogg notes: &ldquo;Apple could continue to sell music via PCs and make its traditional retail margins. This approach doesn&rsquo;t even need an expensive 3-G radio &ndash; which would help Apple keep handset cost, size and weight down and make the handset competitive with (relatively) bloated 3-G handsets sold by operators.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this were to be true, all I have to say, in awe, is&hellip; nice!</p>
