      <p>From the opinion pages of <em>The New York Times</em> yesterday, 13 of February, 2017, also appearing in print today. Some emphasis mine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Trump’s speech and actions demonstrate an <em>inability to tolerate views different from his own</em>, leading to <strong>rage reactions</strong>. His words and behavior suggest a <strong>profound inability to empathize</strong>. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists).</p>
<p>In a powerful leader, these attacks are <strong>likely to increase</strong>, as his personal myth of greatness appears to be confirmed. We believe that the grave emotional instability indicated by Mr. Trump’s speech and actions makes him <strong>incapable of serving</strong> safely as president.</p>

<p>That, of course, is nothing new it as it has been <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/06/the-mind-of-donald-trump/480771/">said</a> before, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/02/12/bernie-sanders-calls-trump-a-pathological-liar-al-franken-says-a-few-republicans-think-trump-is-mentally-ill/">more</a> than one time.</p>
