      <p>No long ago I wrote that <a href="/2015/09/18/i-loathe-emoji/">I loathed Emoji</a>. My main grumble was their usage abuse, and, especially, the overuse of &ldquo;smilies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since Apple&rsquo;s iOS 10, I have been warming up to them, but it wasn&rsquo;t until I came across <a href="http://muan.co/">Mu-An</a> that they really started to captivate me. She uses them, sparingly, but with such taste! A few of <a href="https://github.com/muan/">her repositories</a> exclusively deal with Emoji as well. Thus, this post is to correct myself: I don&rsquo;t loathe Emoji. I actually like them quite a bit.</p>
<p>It all comes down to how they are used. ðŸ˜¸</p>
