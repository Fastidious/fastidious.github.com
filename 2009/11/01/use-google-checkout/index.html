      <p>I was going to write a longer note on Paypal and eBay, but after some time to cool down I do not think it is worth it. Instead I am going to recommend, wholeheartedly, the use of <a href="http://checkout.google.com/">Google Checkout</a> for all your payments and shopping needs. Really, once again Google did not let me down and transformed an otherwise nightmare into a pleasant auctioning/shopping dream.</p>
<p>If you must use eBay, find a way to use <a href="http://checkout.google.com/">Google Checkout</a> with it. You will thank me for it.</p>
