      <p>You will remember my previous <a href="/2009/10/05/avoid-brighthouse/">Bright House</a> post. The same day I wrote that, I got a call from a Bright House customer service representative. Since there is no need to know names, let&rsquo;s call her Christine. I like that name.</p>
<p>Christine told me Bright House was aware I had publicly written about my displeasure with their services, and that her job was to make sure I was completely satisfied. Fair enough. After patiently listening to my long diatribe, and taking notes, she scheduled a technician to come over and take a look. How is that different from any previous iterations, I asked to myself? Well, <em>they</em> contacted me. Maybe this time, just maybe.</p>
<p>The technician arrived, two days later, as agreed. He has to leave early, due to a family emergency, so another appointment is convened for the next day, same time. I have never had problems with Bright House customer service, nor the professionalism of their employees. That has never been the issue.</p>
<p>Next day comes. The technician does a complete check, and replacement. He does new terminations on all cables, inside and outside the house. He replaces my digital, HDMI, cable box. He isolates an old TV &ndash;small one&ndash; in the house, that is &ldquo;injecting&rdquo; signal noise to the rest of the system (the TV was just picked up by the garbage truck this morning), he conducts further tests. All systems a go, OK. Perfect.</p>
<p>Yet, I really would like to have the same competition we have for home phone, for cable TV. As I wrote on my previous post, right now there is none.</p>
<p>Bright House has done the job, and we are happy. How long will it last is yet to be known. It is too soon to say.</p>
