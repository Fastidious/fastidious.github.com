      <p>I have changed, once again, the theme around here, as you can see. Simple approaches have always been my favorites and this one excels in simplicity, hence the name I have given it, &ldquo;Simplissimo&rdquo;. It is a modified version of a <a href="http://pittcrew.net/geekblog/scribbishwp" title="ScribbishWP">WordPress theme</a> based on an original <a href="http://www.quotedprintable.com/pages/scribbish" title="Scribbish">Typo theme</a>. As you can see, I have done slight (or not so slight)  changes to make it mine. And still might change more or I might change it all together. Yes, again.</p>
<p>If you have OpenID enabled on your URI, it will be used when you leave comments and a local account will be created. If not, then it will behave just like any other weblog out there, and set a cookie for you. As I said,  I am still fine tunning; I am also interested on knowing how does it look on a Mac. Bear with me &ndash;or <a href="mailto:david@collantes.us?subject=OpenID usage" title="Contact me">let me know</a>&ndash; if something shows broken.</p>
