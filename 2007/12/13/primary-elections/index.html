In fact, I would not make a requirement to affiliate to a specific party at all.</p>
<p>Why? If I am registered, for example, democrat, but I see that the choices of the Democratic Party are not &ldquo;presidential&rdquo; material, then I would like to be able to vote (even at the primaries) for the best of the other party. Am I making any sense?</p>
<p>The upcoming Presidential Elections will be very interesting (they have already been, having started one year &ndash;or more&ndash; earlier).</p>
