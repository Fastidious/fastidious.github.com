      <p>I have several domains registered at Godaddy. For the ones I care about, I have auto renew enabled. For those I am letting go, I don&rsquo;t. Godaddy gentlemanly reminds me when those about to expire domains are about to do so&hellip; four months in advance! The email &ldquo;reminders&rdquo; do not cease from there on. And then regular mail (snail mail, that is) starts coming to my mailbox as well.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you get it, Godaddy? I do not want to renew those domains. If I wanted, I would have set auto renew. Please stop sending me emails &ndash;you are borderline to spamming&ndash;, stop sending me letters at home. Stop getting in my face.</p>
