      <p>Mark posted yesterday that he will be working for Google, since out of the &ldquo;<a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/03/19/two-visions">two visions</a>&rdquo; of the web, he says, Google is the right one. I am not web savvy nor I really care much about it, but I am sure there is more than two visions on the web, there is not right and wrong, but many, many, many shades in between. But the way I see it, the bottom line in my mind: he is going to work for someone who will pay him very well. Yes, bottom line is all about money. Specially when there is a family to support. And that, my friend, is a single vision, but the most important one of all.</p>
<p>I too would do anything for the well being of my family.</p>
