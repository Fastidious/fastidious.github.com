      <p>&ldquo;What did you have for lunch?,&rdquo; the father asks while driving home. &ldquo;Same as usual,&rdquo; he replies. &ldquo;And that is?&rdquo; &ldquo;I just eat random sandwiches of what comes to whim.&rdquo; The father processes that for a bit. &ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Later, at home, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s there for homework today?&rdquo; &ldquo;No much,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Brush your teeth,&rdquo; he is reminded.

<p>Just before the father goes to sleep, and sees his bedroom lights on. &ldquo;What are you doing up so late? Time to sleep!&rdquo; &ldquo;I am finishing my homework&rdquo; is the reply. &ldquo;But you said it wasn&rsquo;t much!&rdquo; No reply. &ldquo;Take a shower. And remember to brush your teeth.&rdquo;</p>
