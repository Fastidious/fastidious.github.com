      <p>This one is worth <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-new-two-child-policy-and-the-fatal-conceit-1446157377">documenting</a>, as it doesn&rsquo;t happen every day. As a matter of fact, it hasn&rsquo;t happened for over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy">three decades</a>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the latest twist in the most ambitious and ruthless social-engineering program ever undertaken by a modern state: Beijing announced Thursday that the Chinese Communist Party will officially abandon its one-child policy. Yet it has no plans to relinquish authority over its subjects’ birth patterns; rather, Beijing has simply changed the ration. Now two children per family will be permitted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And from one of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">my favorites</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;China said Thursday it would allow all married couples to have two children, signaling the end after 35 years to its drastic and unpopular &ldquo;one-child&rdquo; policy that has been blamed for skewing the gender balance, forcing women into unwanted abortions and bringing about a rapidly aging workforce.&rdquo;&rdquo;</p>
