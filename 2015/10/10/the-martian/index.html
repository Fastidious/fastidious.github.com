      <p>We just came from seeing the movie &ldquo;<a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_martian/">The Martian</a>.&rdquo; Minus the obvious, very predictable, Hollywood scenes, the movie was quite alright.

<p>While on the topic of movies, and theaters, it is amazing how expensive it is to see a movie these days. For three tickets we paid $36.39, and that doesn&rsquo;t include concession stand charges. Yikes!</p>
