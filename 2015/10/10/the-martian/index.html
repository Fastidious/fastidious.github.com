<meta property="og:description" content="We just came from seeing the movie &ldquo;The Martian.&rdquo; Minus the obvious, very predictable, Hollywood scenes, the movie was quite alright. It made me wish I could live to see the first few missions to the Red Planet. Being the selfless guy that I am, thought, I would be willing to settle if my child gets to see them instead.
While on the topic of movies, and theaters, it is amazing how expensive it is to see a movie these days." />
