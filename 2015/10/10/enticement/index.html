      <p>Someone decided to entice us to fill out a survey, by sending us a &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_two-dollar_bill">two dollars bill</a> with it. Normally we do not fill out any type of surveys, unless proper remuneration is provided. Two dollars isn&rsquo;t really worth the effort, and normally would not be accepted as a fee. Yet, since there is no way to send it back with assurances it will reach the original sender, we have a small dilemma on hands.</p>
<p>Thus, as the survey is only two pages, and a grand total of five questions, this time&mdash;and this time only!&mdash;we will abide.</p>
