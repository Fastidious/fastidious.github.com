      <p>Our neighbors are moving. The ones on the left, that is. They have been our neighbors for fifteen years, and lived here for seventeen, since the community was built. Quiet neighbors, the best kind. Now we roll the dice, and hope for the best, for whoever comes next.</p>
<p>The house on the right has had three owners; we have known them all. The first were the previous owners of our house. They left within two years. The second occupants came, and lasted a little longer. Then emptiness. For a while. The current ones have been around for three years, maybe a bit more.</p>
<p>The neighborhood has changed. I wonder when our time will come.</p>
