      <p>Microsoft launched its free (non open source), cross-platform, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">code editor</a> early this year (April, 2015), at its <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">Build Developer Conference</a>.</p>

<p>I have been tempted to try it, as I read its file comparison is very nice, its intelliSense, and it&rsquo;s based on the <a href="https://github.com/atom/electron">same platform</a> as Atom, which <a href="/2015/08/29/using-atom/">I happen to love</a>. Today was <em>the</em> day, but as you can see, it is a non-signed OS X application. Microsoft is big enough, and rich enough to afford signing their OS X applications, but they chose not to. Therefore, I am passing. I am sure it&rsquo;s very nice.</p>
