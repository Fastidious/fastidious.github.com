      <p>As you can see, I have joined the rest of the thousands using the drop shadow, centered approach on their websites/weblogs. There are several things I am not sure yet. Different background colour? Should I make the top and bottom with shadow too, with a space at the top and bottom just like it was before? Should I use this opportunity and make the whole interface 800 wide instead of 640 pixels? Decisions, decisions.. What do you think? Also, can you recommend how to re-structure the side &ldquo;column&rdquo; for the best? What should and should not be there?</p>
<p>We will probably be hiring &ndash;finally!&ndash; the guy that will be our next webmaster today. When this whole odyssey started back in February ([Gee] got the job early January, 2004) I did not know it was going to last this long. Well, I did not know I was going to be around in UCF till now neither. Life has it&rsquo;s twists.</p>

<p>Some have reported problems while browsing this site with IE. I have tried with IE 6 at home and everything looks fine. Could you &ndash;yes, you on the other side of the display&ndash; report on this as well?</p>
