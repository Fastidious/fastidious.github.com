      <p>I woke up at 7:00 AM today, perhaps a bit earlier. The same thing happens every weekend, I cannot sleep as I wish, my internal clock just wouldn&rsquo;t stop buzzing. So here I am, reading my favorites weblog, and news sites while feeling stressed about Monday (or should I say Sunday night?) morning changes at work. It is the weekend, for God&rsquo;s sake! I shouldn&rsquo;t be worrying about anything in the future related to work. I wish it was that easy.</p>
<p>On Linux I know, after years of experience, things work or doesn&rsquo;t. It is that simple. On MS Windows, what doesn&rsquo;t work now might &ldquo;magically&rdquo; start working later or what works now might &ndash;also magically&ndash; stop working at any time. Every action or command is delayed, everything needs restart. You tremble at the thought of what would happen next. On every reboot &ndash;and I am talking about servers here, not your 9X, 2000 or XP machine&ndash; there is the worry of whether or not the machine will come back up. For the sake of me, and others alike, that ought to change.</p>
<p>On a different topic&hellip;</p>
<p>Yesterday I called a friend of mine, BMW car salesman in Fort Lauderdale. Just wanted to say hi. Without giving me time to talk, he started bashing Bush &mdash;the president&mdash;, on how stupid he is, on how this unneeded war is killing so many kids and a lot of other things. All that out of the blue! Now I am not a Bush lover, I just don&rsquo;t like Kerry neither, but when someone gets to the point at which my friend was, only two things could be going on: Bush is so bad, it drives people frantically crazy or, my friend is evidently demented. I thought Bush could win a re-election, now I am not too sure. Why? My friend is not the only one with that &ldquo;demented&rdquo; behavior.</p>
<p>Perhaps the next president will be a guy named John Kerry?</p>
