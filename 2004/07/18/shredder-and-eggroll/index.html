<p>Kent assumes the personality of a different cartoon character &mdash; or hero &mdash; every day. He seems to shuffle between Ninja Turtles, Batman, Danny Phantom, Robin (from &ldquo;Teen Titans&rdquo;), Jackie Chang and others. He has even been Spongebob Squarepants! Needless is to say we &mdash; Kim and I &mdash; are always the bad guys.</p>
<p>Today he decided he was a Ninja Turtle (purple and blue at times) and that Kim and I were Shredders (of different colours, of course). Then Kim told him she was April (don&rsquo;t ask me from what cartoon), which he understood as Eggroll and so a new hero was born: Kim, The Eggroll :-)</p>
<p>Here is him, as Robin (lead hero from &ldquo;Teen Titans&rdquo;). Don&rsquo;t ask me what kind of &ldquo;weapon&rdquo; it is the inflatable mattress pump. It  is, for sure, a super weapon.</p>
<p>Kids these days grow much faster than I did, no doubts. Amazing!</p>
