      <p>Three weeks ago I finally <a href="/2004/03/12/expect-changes/" title="Expect changes">got motivated</a> — read Kim gave me an ultimatum — and sold my two Rolleiflex at eBay. The main purpose of selling them was to buy a digital camera, to replace the one I don&rsquo;t have. But after consideration of:</p>
<ol>
<li>The one I wanted was too expensive.</li>
<li>The body did not come with a lens.</li>
<li>I barely have time to take pictures.</li>
<li>KM has monopolized our home workstation.</li>
</ol>
<p>I decided that the best investment would be to buy a new workstation. So, a week ago I ordered a Dell Dimension XPS and now I type this from it. The XPS is the one with the blue box on this entry banner image. It is big, with plenty space to grow. Some of its details:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3.4 Ghz HT processor with 800 Mhz FSB, 2 Gb of DDR 400 Mhz RAM, 128 Mb DDR ATI Radeon 9800 Pro video card, 120 Gb SATA hard drive, 1 Gbps NIC, LCD, 20&rdquo; DVI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Needless is to say that the system performs are advertised, and that the applications literally &ldquo;fly&rdquo;, even with the HT off. Lots of fun!</p>
<p>I guess the camera will have to wait another three years&hellip;</p>
