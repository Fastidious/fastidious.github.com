      <p>It was just a matter of time until this happened: Google webmail invitations are being sold like crazy on eBay. Some people are even buying one invitation knowing that eventually Google will give two (it has been happening on every new account), so they can resell more. Amazing!</p>
<p>This site looks like crap under Mozilla on Linux, which bothers me a lot. I think I will move things around here soon to accommodate what it might become my desktop OS. I am also tired of looking for banner pictures (I do not longer have a camera, as some of you may know I chose an <a href="/2004/04/04/life-with-an-xps/" title="Life with an XPS">XPS</a> instead), so I may start rotating the banners, instead of having just one per entry&hellip; Or I may not have a banner at all. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>I am also considering <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/" title="Wordpress CMS">Wordpress</a>.</p>
