Just tired, just need more time with my growing kid and family in general." />

      <p>For the very first time I feel like taking a complete break from the weblogging world. I have gone away in the past, but it was never as permanent as I said it would be. Today, for once, I feel I can really do it. That is, break away for a longer time than the previous. Reasons? Just tired, just need more time with my growing kid and family in general.</p>
<p>Whatever reason is, I am taking a break. Will I be gone long? Will I come back tomorrow? Hard to tell. I am not that interesting of a read to start with anyways. Till next time, be good to each other. Do not do anything stupid that you may regret later on. <a href="http://www.spack.org/wiki/MyFathersCreed" title="Brett Shand father's creed">Live an honourable life</a>.</p>
