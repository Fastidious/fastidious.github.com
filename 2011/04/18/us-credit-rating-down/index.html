      <p>It seems our credit “worthiness” (and hence our capabilities to acquired
loans in the future) has diminished:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>S&amp;P maintained its ‘AAA/A-1+’ credit rating on U.S. sovereign debt,
saying the nation’s “highly diversified” economy and “effective monetary
policies” have helped support growth.</p>
<p>But the ratings agency lowered its outlook for America’s long-term
credit rating to “negative” from “stable,” based on the uncertain
political debate around the nation’s fiscal problems.</p>

<p>On this [being in debt up to the head], of course, both parties are to
blame. They seem to be more interested on their own <em>political</em>
agendas and <em>not</em> on the well being of the country.</p>
