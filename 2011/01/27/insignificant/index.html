<p>Do you see the pale dot on the dark image above? You don&rsquo;t see it? Look carefully, it is there! That <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot">pale dot</a> could be us, Earth; but you pick: Solar System, Milky Way, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. We are that insignificant because of the vastness of the universe we live in. And vastness is an understatement. After all, the universe is infinite.</p>
<p>We might try to explain what is at our noses, but that &ldquo;what&rdquo; will always be too insignificant to mean anything more than what is <strong>immediate</strong>. That is why I shake my head and laugh when I read things like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gone back through 96 percent of the life of the universe, to when the universe was only 4 percent of its current age, through 500 million years after the Big Bang [&hellip;]&rdquo;</p>
