      <p>After much thought, and tinkering, I decided to ditch my six year old or so WordPress and start <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html" title="Blogging like a hacker">blogging like a hacker</a> with the awesome <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll, not Hyde">Jekyll</a>.</p>
<p>I am still getting a few things in place, like making sure <strong>all</strong> entries are properly converted to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" title="Markdown syntax">markdown</a>, but overall I am liking this. A lot. I do not longer need MySQL, nor PHP. It is a no sweat setup! Some might say, back to basics. Yup.</p>
<p>Anyway, let me know if you find anything broken &mdash;the video links were broken, now fixed!&mdash; and I will tackle it.</p>
