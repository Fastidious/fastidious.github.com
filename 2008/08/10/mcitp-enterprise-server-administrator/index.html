      <p>The last two weeks were very busy ones. I went through a Boot Camp and obtained the Microsoft Certified Information Technology Professional certification, as an Enterprise Server 2008 Administrator. Much more to do with the product, but migration is on my close horizon.</p>
<p>As a side note, and totally unrelated, I will change the way this weblog look soon. I will probably start over as well, all the old content gone. Not sure yet about that last part, but it is a possibility.</p>
