<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Normally, when America goes to war, nonessential spending programs are reduced to make room in the budget for the higher costs of the war. Individual programs that benefit specific constituencies are sacrificed for the common good &hellip; And taxes have never been cut during a major American war. For example, President Eisenhower adamantly resisted pressure from Senate Republicans for a tax cut during the Korean War.&ldquo;</p>
<p>Said Mr. Stiglitz: &ldquo;Because the administration actually cut taxes as we went to war, when we were already running huge deficits, this war has, effectively, been entirely financed by deficits. The national debt has increased by some $2.5 trillion since the beginning of the war, and of this, almost $1 trillion is due directly to the war itself &hellip; By 2017, we estimate that the national debt will have increased, just because of the war, by some $2 trillion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people do not grasp the immense implications of this.</p>
