      <p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/05/barackobama.hillaryclinton">Obama accuses Clinton of using the language of Bush on Iran</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the sharpest attack, Obama said that Clinton&rsquo;s threat to &ldquo;totally obliterate&rdquo; Iran should it attempt a nuclear attack on Israel was inappropriate. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the language we need right now. It&rsquo;s language that&rsquo;s reflective of George Bush,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Obama said it was time to get away from a foreign policy of &ldquo;bluster and sabre-rattling and tough talk&rdquo;. He reminded Clinton that she had urged caution in terms of speculating about Iran on the campaign trail &ldquo;yet a few days before an election she&rsquo;s willing to use that language&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Obama&rsquo;s comments, made on Meet the Press on NBC, were put to Clinton as she appeared simultaneously on ABC&rsquo;s This Week. She remained unapologetic: &ldquo;I think we have to be very clear about what we would do. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s time to equivocate. [Iran has] to know they would face massive retaliation. That is the only way to rein them in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Asked by George Stephanopoulos, a former aide to Bill Clinton in the White House, whether she had any regrets over her Iran remarks, she replied: &ldquo;No, why would I have any regrets?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I specially like <a href="http://digg.com/2008_us_elections/Clinton_Has_No_Regrets_Concerning_Her_Obliterating_Iran?t=15039246#c15039246">one of Diggers comment</a> to this entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because you are advocating the wholesale slaughter of 65,875,223 men, women and children (according to the most recent US Government estimate) all but a tiny tiny fraction of whom wouldn&rsquo;t have had anything to do with a decision to attack Israel. You&rsquo;d be guilty of genocide more than 10 times worse than Hitler. By murdering an entire nation of mostly civilians you&rsquo;d be guilty of a war crime greater than any in the history of the world. That&rsquo;s why you might consider regretting it you madwoman!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://digg.com/2008_us_elections/Clinton_Has_No_Regrets_Concerning_Her_Obliterating_Iran?t=15039246#c15056935">this one</a>, my feelings exactly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Man, if she wins the Democratic candidacy and the vote comes down between McCain and Clinton, America is *****.</p>
