      <p>Christmas is not the same without watching certain films. The ones that are always a must for me are &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lampoon%27s_European_Vacation">National Lampoon&rsquo;s European Vacation</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lampoon%27s_Christmas_Vacation">National Lampoon&rsquo;s Christmas Vacation</a>&rdquo;. As I type this I am getting ready to watch them both. Those are the ones to laugh to tears and have fun. The other favourite one &ndash;please don&rsquo;t hate me&ndash; is &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music">The Sound of Music</a>.&rdquo; There is something about it that just does it for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The hills are alive, with the sound of music!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funnily enough, Clark and family make fun of this one on &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Lampoon%27s_European_Vacation">National Lampoon&rsquo;s European Vacation</a>.&rdquo;</p>
