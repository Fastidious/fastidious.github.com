      <p>Bernie Sanders has had a good run. Yet numbers are pilled against him, and he should know it. After all he said he was &ldquo;<a href="https://twitter.com/CNN/status/740423466592141312">pretty good in arithmetic</a>.&rdquo; Hillary has beaten him, and the right and honorable thing for him to do is to call it quits.</p>

<p>I know it is satire, of course. But Bernie&rsquo;s insistency on &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/09/us/politics/bernie-sanders-campaign.html">fighting on</a>&rdquo; (who, or what I am not really sure anymore) is disappointing.</p>
