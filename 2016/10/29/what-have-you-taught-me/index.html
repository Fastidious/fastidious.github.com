      <p>His father was only giving him a small advise, worried for him. Parents worry too much, sometimes. It was not taken well.</p>
<p><em>“You suffocate me, don’t worry so much about me! Enough advise, what have you taught me, until now?”</em> He asks. Perhaps no much, the father thinks in retrospect. Brushing the teeth, maybe? Lacing the shoes? How to clean the arse? How to respect others, and do good? To be happy, love, study hard, work hard? That, and the many little things of daily life. He can’t remember much, but one thing he knows for sure: he has loved him, and will continue to love him until the end.</p>
<p>Ah, that too! He has taught him how to give unconditional love.</p>
