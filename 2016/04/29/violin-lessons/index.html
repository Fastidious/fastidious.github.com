      <p>Just as they started, randomly, on a whim, as a child desire to learn to play the violin, the lessons that Kent has been taking for almost two years came to an end two weeks ago. It was hard to tell Julie &mdash; his teacher &mdash; that he was not to continue, but it was what he wanted.</p>
<p>Kent never intended to play violin professionally, it was no more than an artistic hobby. As such, he can hold the violin and extract out of it some lamenting notes. This entry is for the records. Who knows, maybe one day he will go back to it. For the time being, the violin languishes, yearning for his master&rsquo;s touch.</p>
