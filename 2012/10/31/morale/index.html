      <p>Last week <a href="/2012/10/21/spelling-bee/">I wrote</a> about Kent’s Spelling Bee, and how preparing for it was hard for him and I.</p>
<p>Well, the Bee came and went, and I forgot to come back to post the results. He misspelled &ldquo;<em>morale</em>&rdquo; (he spelled it as &ldquo;<em>moral</em>&quot;) and finished in 4th place&mdash;for me, it doesn’t make sense, as I have always considered first, second and third place relevant, but fourth?&mdash;, which still qualified him to go to the State competition. That, of course, means more practice and hence more pain.</p>
