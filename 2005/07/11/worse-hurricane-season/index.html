      <p>With Dennis &ndash;the hurricane, that is&ndash; Florida has had 5 hurricanes in less than a year. And it seems it <em>could</em> get a bit worse.</p>

<p><strong>LOXAHATCHEE, FL</strong> &ndash; A wildlife expert in south Florida says turtles may be giving us a sign that the hurricane season ahead is going to be a bad one.</p>
<p>Lyle Thomas said he&rsquo;s noticed turtles at the edge of the Everglades have nested just about as high as they can in earthen levees.</p>
<p>Thomas operates Loxahatchee Everglade Tours and said he first noticed the turtles moving higher last year, before four hurricanes hit Florida.</p>
<p>This year, Thomas said, the nests are even higher than they were last year.  &ndash; <cite><a href="http://www.wftv.com/news/4583160/detail.html" title="Man Says Turtle Nesting Could Be Sign Of Hurricanes To Come">WFTV News</a></cite></p>
