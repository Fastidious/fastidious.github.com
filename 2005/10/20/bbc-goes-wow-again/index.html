<p>I&rsquo;ts popularity can be primarily attributed to its accessibility. The game is easy, plain and simple.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more forgiving than most other online role-playing games on the market, and does not take as much dedicated playing or &ldquo;grinding&rdquo; to reach the top level. It appeals to a casual market and a broader spectrum of ages.</p>

<p>Tryggr, my main character, has reached level 57 now. A Rogue (dwarf) level 20 and a Paladin (dwarf) level 29 keeps him in company. All still in Argent Dawn. Kent characters, a Priest (night elf) level 10 (Alviss) and an Mage (undead) level 5 (Luciferous) reside on the same server.</p>
<p>What can I say, WoW is awesome! :-)</p>
