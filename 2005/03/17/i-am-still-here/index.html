      <p>It has been a while since I came to talk. I am afraid this time I will not talk much either. Between work, family, a game (I used not to play any game at all. Now the whole family has been playing <a href="http://www.toontown.com/" title="Toon Town">Toon Town</a> for almost 5 months. Give it a try, it is addictive! :-) ) and a few personal projects I had had little time to come here and chatter. But I am still here, I will come back. I want to upgrade to the latest Wordpress, I want to change a few things around. David is around guys and gals, albeit reclusive.</p>
