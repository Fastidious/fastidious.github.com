      <p>Friends are not easy to come by. They are made, just like good wine, after many years of ageing. At a certain point, which is hard to pinpoint, they cease to be just friends to become family. Just like a family member would, and should, they give you the best advise, uncompromisingly, unabashedly, unreservedly. They praise your virtues and take pride on them, but are quick to call out the stupid things you are bound to do. They are patient, they forgive, they forget. They listen, and they are always available.</p>
<p>John Chitty was a friend, who became family, whom I loved very much. He died peacefully tonight. He will be forever missed and remembered.</p>
