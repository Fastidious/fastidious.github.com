      <p>Drivers in Orlando do not seem to know what to do when they reach a four way stop. It really makes me wonder how were they able to obtain a drivers license without that knowledge, as it is part of <a href="http://www.stateofflorida.com/Portal/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=212">Drivers Handbook</a> (search for &ldquo;Stop Signs&rdquo; on that page), the test, and occasionally encountered while driving.</p>
<p>For the record, and in case you live in Orlando, and do not know  what to do on a four-way stop (also known as all-way stop), these are the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li>You fully stop, it is a stop sign after all.</li>
<li>First car to the stop sign goes first, after a full stop.</li>
<li>If two or more cars reach the stop sign at the same time, the car to your right goes first.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple, right? Don&rsquo;t fail at it again! I am looking at you, <a href="http://www.simon.com/mall/waterford-lakes-town-center/about">Waterford Lakes</a>!</p>
