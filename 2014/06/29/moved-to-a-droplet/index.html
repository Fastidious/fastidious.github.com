      <p>Having wished for a while to run this little site on SSL &mdash;as well as having the freedom to do more things&mdash; which GitHub does not allow, I have finally decided to move to a virtual server of my own.

<p><a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=80ee9e811207">DigitalOcean</a> droplets web interface is very clean, simple, responsive and functional. Spawning the server took 54 seconds, and configuring <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a> took 15 minutes, SSL included. I ordered and received my SSL certificate while quickly configuring <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a>; kudos to <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> and <a href="http://ssl.comodo.com/">Comodo</a> for a speedy service.</p>
