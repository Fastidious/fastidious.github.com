      <p>When Apple announced the iCloud Drive integration in Yosemite, I got really excited. As I was already part of the &ldquo;Apple ecosystem&rdquo; (iPhone, iPad, iMac), the iCloud Drive availability in all, specially on the desktop, seemed like the culmination of all my dreams: a Cloud to rule them all. I ordered the 200 GB for $4 a month right away.</p>
<p>As it turns out with products in infancy, the iCloud Drive is no yet mature. My single complain, but a very important one, is the lack of selective synchronization. The absence of such feature kills the product for my intended use completely, and so I will wait until it is added. Back to the free, 5 GB plan.</p>
