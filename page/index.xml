      <description>Ego Hi there, welcome! You are now browsing my personal blog. In here I write about whatever happens to interest me from time to time. I am a father and a husband living in Orlando, FL, U.S.A.
I have worked for the Florida Educational System as a system administrator (sysadmin) since June of 1996 or whereabouts, but nothing on this site is affiliated with, sponsored, or endorsed by them.</description>

      <description> These are several tools compiled from all around, that I use every once in a while. I keep them here, just because it is handy to have them all in one place. All of them run in the browser, no server side component, other than holding and serving the files via HTTPS.
