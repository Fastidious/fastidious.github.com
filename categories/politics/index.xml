      <description>Someone is having another meltdown.
 The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!

Now, there is a background for his latest fit.
Yesterday, 16 March, Jeff Sessions fired Andrew McCabe, the FBI deputy director.</description>

      <description>I have disliked other presidents in the past, for actions taken while they were in the office that I ‚Äî and many others ‚Äî considered stupid, crazy, or just plain wrong. My dislike for the current president eclipses any of my previous. I voted for Hillary, and wrongly predicted that she would win the presidency.
Today news, although perhaps inconsequential, brings joy to an otherwise political nightmare.

      <description>Soon to be ex-Senator Al Franken announced, on an emotional speech, his resignation yesterday. He is leaving the Senate after been accused of sexual misconduct.
 &amp;ldquo;I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault sits in the Oval Office, and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party.</description>

      <description>Henry Louis Mencken wrote an article on the Baltimore Sun, on 26 July, 1920, that amongst other things read:
 As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart&amp;rsquo;s desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.</description>

      <description>This is, at least for me, completely surreal. It is not only that Trump sacked the FBI director &amp;mdash; who arguably helped him getting elected President &amp;mdash; while he was conducting an investigation on Trump&amp;rsquo;s presidential campaign, but the way he wrote the sacking letter (I emphasised):
 Dear Director Comey:
I have received the attached letters from the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney General of the United States recommending your dismissal as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</description>

 The most amazing thing about the Trump presidency is that it‚Äôs made GWB look like a reasonably intelligent person.

 And from The New York Times:
 Former President George W. Bush said Monday &amp;ldquo;we all need answers&amp;rdquo; on the extent of contact between President Donald Trump&amp;rsquo;s team and the Russian government, and didn&amp;rsquo;t rule out the idea that a special prosecutor could be necessary to lead an investigation.</description>

      <description>There is a reason why I subscribed to the digital edition of The New York Times. Its journalists are superb; it is a paper I trust, and have found to be veridical after cross referencing the news they post with other major, equally trusted, news sources.
From yesterday&amp;rsquo;s edition (some emphasis mine):
 The story so far: A foreign dictator intervened on behalf of a U.S. presidential candidate ‚Äî and that candidate won.</description>

      <description>From the opinion pages of The New York Times yesterday, 13 of February, 2017, also appearing in print today. Some emphasis mine.
 Mr. Trump‚Äôs speech and actions demonstrate an inability to tolerate views different from his own, leading to rage reactions. His words and behavior suggest a profound inability to empathize. Individuals with these traits distort reality to suit their psychological state, attacking facts and those who convey them (journalists, scientists).</description>

      <description>If you hear or read this somewhere else &amp;mdash; whether on social media, or via your clueless uncle Olaf &amp;mdash; you will find it hard, if not impossible, to believe. Now, finding it on Reuters is a different story.
 In his first call as president with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump denounced a treaty that caps U.S. and Russian deployment of nuclear warheads as a bad deal for the United States, according to two U.</description>

      <description>Not presidential at all.
 ‚ÄúPresident-elect Donald J. Trump‚Äôs aides often cite his appearances at professional wrestling matches as an inspiration for his outsize political speaking style, and his buoyantly belligerent news conference in New York on Wednesday proved he has no plans to betray his brawler‚Äôs roots in the service of seeming more presidential.‚Äù

      <description>Back in October 5th, 2015, I wrote a prediction, which I saved in a file for which I posted a hash. I predicted that Hillary Clinton would win the United States presidential elections. Sadly, I was wrong.
I really do not have much else to say. I am sorry.</description>

      <description>Bernie Sanders has had a good run. Yet numbers are pilled against him, and he should know it. After all he said he was &amp;ldquo;pretty good in arithmetic.&amp;rdquo; Hillary has beaten him, and the right and honorable thing for him to do is to call it quits.
 ‚ÄúIf, on November 8th of this year, Hillary Clinton is elected President, we will have only begun to fight,‚Äù Sanders told a packed rally in San Francisco.</description>

      <description>The United States government demanded that Apple weakens the security on iOS. Tim Cook, Apple&amp;rsquo;s CEO, replied.
 Rather than asking for legislative action through Congress, the FBI is proposing an unprecedented use of the All Writs Act of 1789 to justify an expansion of its authority.
The government would have us remove security features and add new capabilities to the operating system, allowing a passcode to be input electronically. This would make it easier to unlock an iPhone by ‚Äúbrute force,‚Äù trying thousands or millions of combinations with the speed of a modern computer.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;DOD charged the American taxpayer $43 million for what is likely the world&amp;rsquo;s most expensive gas station.&amp;rdquo;
That&amp;rsquo;s what Special Inspector General John F. Sopko found when he looked at the construction of a natural gas station in Sheberghan, Afghanistan.
According to the report, at most that station should have cost about $500,000. But in this case, the Department of Defense&amp;rsquo;s Task Force for Stability and Business Operations awarded Central Asian Engineering a contract to build the station for a little under $3 million.</description>

      <description>This one is worth documenting, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen every day. As a matter of fact, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened for over three decades.
 &amp;ldquo;It is the latest twist in the most ambitious and ruthless social-engineering program ever undertaken by a modern state: Beijing announced Thursday that the Chinese Communist Party will officially abandon its one-child policy. Yet it has no plans to relinquish authority over its subjects‚Äô birth patterns; rather, Beijing has simply changed the ration.</description>

      <description>We bomb. From the air, from the ground, from afar, from ships. And so do the Russians now. We target what we believe are terrorists, sometimes we miss. Russians are doing the same now.
We removed Saddam, and the Taliban, just to mention two, and that created&amp;mdash;or increased&amp;mdash;a mess that continues until today. The Russian&amp;rsquo;s tactic is different, they are targeting both, the terrorists fighting against the &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; regime, and those which we are targeting as well.</description>

Below is the name of a file with my winner&amp;rsquo;s prediction on the United States 2016 Presidential Elections written on it. It is a hash algorithm of a file containing a sentence with my prediction. I will refer to this post the day after elections, as the results are known.</description>

      <description>Back in 2011 was the last time I wrote about Presidential Elections (2012). I can&amp;rsquo;t believe we are about to get into them again. In 2012 I knew exactly who to vote for, but in 2016, with the selection we have thus far, I really have no idea about who is the most viable&amp;mdash;if there is one. Certainly not this one:

 &amp;ldquo;I spoke with Kim Davis this morning to offer my prayers and support.

      <description>It seems our credit ‚Äúworthiness‚Äù (and hence our capabilities to acquired loans in the future) has diminished:
 S&amp;amp;P maintained its ‚ÄòAAA/A-1+‚Äô credit rating on U.S. sovereign debt, saying the nation‚Äôs ‚Äúhighly diversified‚Äù economy and ‚Äúeffective monetary policies‚Äù have helped support growth.
But the ratings agency lowered its outlook for America‚Äôs long-term credit rating to ‚Äúnegative‚Äù from ‚Äústable,‚Äù based on the uncertain political debate around the nation‚Äôs fiscal problems.

 North Korea said on Monday it would issue new won currency this week that would in effect lop two zeros off the old &amp;mdash;requiring 1,000-won bills, for example, to be exchanged for 10-won notes with, theoretically, the same buying power.
It said it would limit the amount of old currency it would accept in exchange, to the equivalent of about $40 worth at unofficial exchange rates.</description>

      <description>News broke this morning that Senator Clinton made three separate loans to her campaign in the past 30 days &amp;mdash;including one as recently as Monday.
These loans total more than $6.4 million, which combined with her previous personal loans, add up to at least $11.4 million she&amp;rsquo;s loaned her campaign since February.
A spokesman said she may continue to &amp;ldquo;loan the campaign additional money out of her jointly-held assets&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;which include more than $100 million in income since her husband left the White House.</description>

 In the sharpest attack, Obama said that Clinton&amp;rsquo;s threat to &amp;ldquo;totally obliterate&amp;rdquo; Iran should it attempt a nuclear attack on Israel was inappropriate. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not the language we need right now. It&amp;rsquo;s language that&amp;rsquo;s reflective of George Bush,&amp;rdquo; he said.
Obama said it was time to get away from a foreign policy of &amp;ldquo;bluster and sabre-rattling and tough talk&amp;rdquo;.</description>

 I find it incredible how she has been able to get as many votes as she has. But after seeing McCain take over the Republican&amp;rsquo;s vote I should have expected anything.</description>

We&amp;mdash;as in the U.S.A.&amp;mdash;are not being fair with China. Our government and our politicians (including Presidential aspirants) are all playing politics with the Olympics for their own political advantage.</description>

      <description>I used to listen to talk radio after 3PM. I listened at the Sean Hannity show, on WDBO 580AM. I just realized yesterday his &amp;lsquo;show&amp;rsquo; is a radio political &amp;ndash;and biased&amp;ndash; version of &amp;ldquo;The Jerry Springer&amp;rdquo; show. Full of junk, inaccuracies, lies sprinkled with some trues, repetitive. I should have stopped at junk.
And I listened for the entertainment, for the laugh it gives every once in a while, and as a background noise on my way home.</description>

      <description>Obama spurns double ticket hints
 &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how somebody who is in second place is offering the vice presidency to somebody who is in first place,&amp;rdquo; he told a rally in Columbus, Mississippi.
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want anybody here thinking that somehow &amp;lsquo;well, you know, maybe I can get both.&amp;rsquo; Don&amp;rsquo;t think that way. You have to make a choice in this election.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not running for vice president. I am running for president of the United States of America,&amp;rdquo; he added.</description>

 &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s 3AM and your children are sleeping. But the phone is ringing. It&amp;rsquo;s your mortgage lender, calling to let you know that you are 180 days late on your payment for that crazy mortgage you agreed to. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, because your phone was disconnected a long time ago. But no worries, Hillary Clinton is working late, at some desk somewhere, doing a Sudoku puzzle maybe.</description>

      <description>Bush endorses McCain in US race
 US President George W Bush has endorsed John McCain&amp;rsquo;s White House bid after the Vietnam veteran sealed the Republican nomination on Tuesday.
Mr Bush said his one-time rival would be a president with the &amp;ldquo;determination to defeat an enemy and a heart big enough to love those who hurt&amp;rdquo;.
 Now you know who not to vote for. Clear, right? Any questions?</description>

      <description>The $2 Trillion Nightmare
 &amp;ldquo;Normally, when America goes to war, nonessential spending programs are reduced to make room in the budget for the higher costs of the war. Individual programs that benefit specific constituencies are sacrificed for the common good &amp;hellip; And taxes have never been cut during a major American war. For example, President Eisenhower adamantly resisted pressure from Senate Republicans for a tax cut during the Korean War.</description>

Yes, I hope she looses.

      <description>George Lakoff: What Counts as an &amp;ldquo;Issue&amp;rdquo; In the Clinton-Obama Race?
 There is a reason that Obama recently spoke of Reagan. Reagan understood that you win elections by drawing support from independents and the opposite side. He understood what unified the country so that he could lead it according to his vision. His vision was a radical conservative one, a vision devastating for the country and contradicted by his economic policies.</description>

      <description>U.S. Seeks Silence on CIA Prisons
 The Bush administration has told a federal judge that terrorism suspects held in secret CIA prisons should not be allowed to reveal details of the &amp;ldquo;alternative interrogation methods&amp;rdquo; that their captors used to get them to talk.
The government says in new court filings that those interrogation methods are now among the nation&amp;rsquo;s most sensitive national security secrets and that their release &amp;ndash; even to the detainees&amp;rsquo; own attorneys &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;could reasonably be expected to cause extremely grave damage.</description>

      <description>Ron Paul: War and Foreign Policy
 We can continue to fund and fight no-win police actions around the globe, or we can refocus on securing America and bring the troops home. No war should ever be fought without a declaration of war voted upon by the Congress, as required by the Constitution.
Under no circumstances should the U.S. again go to war as the result of a resolution that comes from an unelected, foreign body, such as the United Nations.</description>

Why? If I am registered, for example, democrat, but I see that the choices of the Democratic Party are not &amp;ldquo;presidential&amp;rdquo; material, then I would like to be able to vote (even at the primaries) for the best of the other party.</description>

That really makes me mad. I would make it part of the process of being elected: if you win, you cannot take over office until you clean up all your garbage. And if they don&amp;rsquo;t, a hefty fine gets applied, they get ridiculed and their seat is up for claiming.</description>

It took them three years to develop something that can be tested (a bomb), or were they working already on it for a long time and our intelligence was &amp;lsquo;asleep&amp;rsquo;? If it was the first, they could already have a way to deliver it overseas, and if it is the second, we may not even know it.</description>

      <description>The overturn of the elections in Spain was driven by several factors. Leftists accused the PP (Popular Party) of lying and one have to assume that socialists voters believed it. Aznar got Spain into a war that was considered by many as non-needed, following an agresive and self-centered ideology.
The truth is that while the war was out of spanish campgrounds everything was limited to talks about veracity of the (war) facts, justice and geostrategy.</description>

I mean, does Google AdSense can be enough for someone to actually make a living out if it? And, on a related token, would the amount of &amp;ldquo;donations&amp;rdquo; add up enough to pay the rent? I am curious.
On politics. I am a republican although I am not sure if I will vote like so on the next Presidential elections.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am proudly a republican. I did not vote on the last presidential election for a technicality: I moved from one county to another a week before elections and I lost my right to vote, just because of bad timing. But I would have voted for Mr. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also supported the war against Saddam Hussein and his army, because I think the world is better off without a man like him on power. I did not care whether or not he had &amp;ldquo;weapons of mass destruction&amp;rdquo;, I knew the guy history and that was enough justification for me. But, if I remember well, the war was sold, &lt;b&gt;mainly&lt;/b&gt;, on the existence of WMD, whilst it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t. We had thousands of other reasons to go to war against that mad man. Why WMD were made the &amp;ldquo;key&amp;rdquo; reason I do not know. And now we have a problem in our hands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Looks like the only thing a poor country, or a country in deep economical problems, has to do to turn things around and get all major powers striving to come up with a solution &amp;mdash;which in the case I am talking about is recognition, non-aggression treaty and, most important of all, economical aid&amp;mdash; is to publicly say it is going to build a nuclear bomb or that is in the process to do it.</description>

      <description>If you have been following the news you already know about the Iraq situation. You might still be asking yourself why are we building up such a massive military power in the area, that is, Middle East. Right, you are not questioning that, since you know the answer: we are going to war. What you might be thinking is whether or not we should be there, should we care. All valid questions.</description>
