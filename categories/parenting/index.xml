      <description>His father was only giving him a small advise, worried for him. Parents worry too much, sometimes. It was not taken well.
“You suffocate me, don’t worry so much about me! Enough advise, what have you taught me, until now?” He asks. Perhaps no much, the father thinks in retrospect. Brushing the teeth, maybe? Lacing the shoes? How to clean the arse? How to respect others, and do good? To be happy, love, study hard, work hard?</description>
