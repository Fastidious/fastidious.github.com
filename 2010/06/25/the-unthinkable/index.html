<p>Yesterday I did the unthinkable. Something I have never done &mdash; nor will I do again &mdash; before. I went very early (03:15) to stand at the Millenia all, to be one of the first (or so I thought) to buy the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone 4</a>.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to write long about something I am more than half way ashamed of. Suffice it to say that I got an iPhone 4 after standing in line for 14 hours (17:15). Never again.</p>
<p>The photo above was taken by <a href="http://george.tsiokos.com/">George</a>, around 11:30, not even half way my day there. Did I say never again?</p>
