It is the evening before Thanksgiving and a long weekend is ahead. My parents are coming up to visit on Friday, so I guess it is going to be quite busy. I am back, logs shall flow, as they did before. I have a lot to talk about and I certainly need to come here to upload." />

      <p>Howdy all! Finally coming back on track now. Kid still sick but getting better, pain on my back still there, but feeling hopeful on both fronts.</p>
<p>It is the evening before Thanksgiving and a long weekend is ahead. My parents are coming up to visit on Friday, so I guess it is going to be quite busy. I am back, logs shall flow, as they did before. I have a lot to talk about and I certainly need to come here to upload.</p>
<p>For my fellow Americans, enjoy Thanksgiving, be safe &ndash;specially if you are driving. For my international audience, have a nice weekend!!</p>
<p>Ah, Happy Birthday Martin!</p>
