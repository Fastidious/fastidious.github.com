      <p>I have been quite quiet lately, I know. I have been going to sleep early and, when not, thinking and working on other site, which is not finished yet, by the way. I have been reading a bit too, something I used to do more and had neglected.</p>
<p>I am buying a Tablet PC soon (like tomorrow or so). It will be my first laptop in 9 years. I will let you know my first impressions as soon as I have it on my hands.</p>
<p>Going to sleep now. I hope to have more interesting things to write within a day or two. It will be hard when I open the other website, since I will have to share writings. In here there will always be my personal entries, on &ldquo;the other&rdquo; will be more general, mostly my (and others) thoughts about things/events. I will keep you posted. Good night!</p>
