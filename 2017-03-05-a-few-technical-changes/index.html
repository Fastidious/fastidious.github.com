      <p>A few things have happened on my current server setup. The biggest one was my move from <a href="https://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> to <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. I do not have complains about FreeBSD &mdash; how could I? &mdash; but I wanted to play with more recent stuff, and it was becoming very hard to do under BSD. I also wanted a refresh, since I had been running that VPS for a while and it was starting to feel &ldquo;dirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, I spawned up an <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/">Ubuntu 16.04 LTS</a> VPS, and migrated. It all worked like a charm, took couple of hours, mostly because I really enjoy doing things manually, without automation. To top it off, <a href="http://www.vultr.com/?ref=6815414">Vultr</a> (affiliated link) upgraded their plans (and launched a brand new, $2.50/month one), so I now have 1GB RAM, and 25GB SSD, for my $5/month plan. Such a sweet deal!</p>
<p>I also changed my blog static generator from <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to <a href="http://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. The move was driven by the desire to gain speed (Hugo, writen in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, is very fast), and by wishing to get rid of the many dependencies Jekyll has (being Ruby based and all). Additionally, I am hosting a presence, albeit pretty simple, for all my domains, all under <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Letscrypt</a> SSL. I am also using <a href="https://gitea.io/">Gitea</a> to manage my <a href="https://git-scm.com/">gits</a> via the web. This very own weblog is generated upon a commit.</p>
<p>Finally, I am also running a second Ubuntu server on Azure, which I am using as my <a href="https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn">VPN</a>, and test server, for now.</p>
