      <title>A Dangerous Precedent</title>

      <description>The United States government demanded that Apple weakens the security on iOS. Tim Cook, Apple&amp;rsquo;s CEO, replied.
 Rather than asking for legislative action through Congress, the FBI is proposing an unprecedented use of the All Writs Act of 1789 to justify an expansion of its authority.
The government would have us remove security features and add new capabilities to the operating system, allowing a passcode to be input electronically. This would make it easier to unlock an iPhone by “brute force,” trying thousands or millions of combinations with the speed of a modern computer.</description>

      <title>Apple on Encryption</title>

      <description>Apple mobile devices&amp;mdash;iPhones, iPads, iPods&amp;mdash;are used everywhere. The US smartphone subscriber market share highest percentage is dominated by them. As an American company, they are bound to comply with U.S. laws and regulations. So, when the U.S. Justice Department requested that Apple grants access to a locked iPhone, Apple brought the case to court.
 Apple Inc told a U.S. judge that accessing data stored on a locked iPhone would be &amp;ldquo;impossible&amp;rdquo; with devices using its latest operating system, but the company has the &amp;ldquo;technical ability&amp;rdquo; to help law enforcement unlock older phones.</description>

      <title>About the removal of Garbage Apps</title>

      <description>Tim Cook answered a few questions for BuzzFeed, while they talked about things iPhone, iPad Pro, and many other Apple&amp;ndash;related things. This part got close to me, as I am sure it might be to anyone who likes iPhones. Why can&amp;rsquo;t we remove certain apps?
 Why are there apps on the iOS that I can’t delete even though I never use them? Why does Apple insist that I keep Tips and Stocks”on my iPhone when I’d like nothing more than to delete them?</description>

      <title>iCloud mess</title>
      <link>https://collantes.us/2015/05/02/icloud-mess/</link>

      <description>Having lost many photos of certain sentimental value a few years ago has made me paranoid. Ever since I lost my child&amp;rsquo;s first four years of photographic memory I have kept copies of our family photos and videos in two different places. I keep a copy of photos and videos in our Synology NAS at home, which backup photos to Amazon S3 and videos to Glacier.
When Apple announced their iCloud plans, and the ability to keep my entire photo library on the cloud, I was one of the first to sign up.</description>

      <title>iCloud Drive on standby</title>

      <description>When Apple announced the iCloud Drive integration in Yosemite, I got really excited. As I was already part of the &amp;ldquo;Apple ecosystem&amp;rdquo; (iPhone, iPad, iMac), the iCloud Drive availability in all, specially on the desktop, seemed like the culmination of all my dreams: a Cloud to rule them all. I ordered the 200 GB for $4 a month right away.
As it turns out with products in infancy, the iCloud Drive is no yet mature.</description>

      <description>I am not sure about the other mobile telephony providers, but this morning I went to T-Mobile with the intention of buying an iPad mini. They had only the dark colour in stock, and on 32GB capacity &amp;ndash; I was wanting a 16GB. The transaction was almost finished, when I was asked for a telephone number. After stating that I just wanted the iPad, no connection, I was told they could only sell it, if it was with a mobile data plan.</description>

      <title>Stephen Fry on Steve Jobs</title>

      <description>Stephen Fry is an English actor, screenwriter, author, playwright, journalist, poet, comedian, television presenter, film director and a director of Norwich City Football Club. He is also an awesome human being.
 As always there are those who reveal their asininity (as they did throughout his career) with ascriptions like &amp;ldquo;salesman&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;showman&amp;rdquo; or the giveaway blunder &amp;ldquo;triumph of style over substance&amp;rdquo;. The use of that last phrase, &amp;ldquo;style over substance&amp;rdquo; has always been, as Oscar Wilde observed, a marvellous and instant indicator of a fool.</description>

      <description>A great man has passed away. While mourning, we celebrate all he brought to us&amp;hellip; his many accomplishments. He will not be forgotten.

      <description>Steve Jobs &amp;ldquo;resigns&amp;rdquo; as Apple&amp;rsquo;s C.E.O.
 &amp;ldquo;I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s C.E.O., I would be the first to let you know,&amp;rdquo; Mr. Jobs wrote. &amp;ldquo;Unfortunately, that day has come.&amp;rdquo;
 The world needs more Steve Jobs. He will be missed. Get better Steve!</description>

      <description>Yesterday I did the unthinkable. Something I have never done &amp;mdash; nor will I do again &amp;mdash; before. I went very early (03:15) to stand at the Millenia all, to be one of the first (or so I thought) to buy the iPhone 4.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want to write long about something I am more than half way ashamed of. Suffice it to say that I got an iPhone 4 after standing in line for 14 hours (17:15).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s decided, my next machine will be an Apple computer. Most likely I will end up buying a Mac Mini, although an iMac is also being considered. Now, who wants a (still under warranty) DELL XPS 630i? It is a Q6600 (quad), with 4GB RAM, 500GB HD, and NVIDIA 9800GT. Comes with Windows 7 Ultimate. Nice machine!

      <title>Thoughts on Flash</title>

      <description>Steve Jobs shared with us this month his thoughts on Flash:
 &amp;ldquo;Flash was created during the PC era &amp;mdash;for PCs and mice. Flash is a successful business for Adobe, and we can understand why they want to push it beyond PCs. But the mobile era is about low power devices, touch interfaces and open web standards &amp;mdash;all areas where Flash falls short.
The avalanche of media outlets offering their content for Apple’s mobile devices demonstrates that Flash is no longer necessary to watch video or consume any kind of web content.</description>

      <description>I thought twice before coming here and write two or three sentences. But sometimes two or three sentences is all you have. I had to do it: Apple Inc., you rock!
If you want to be a &amp;ldquo;journalist&amp;rdquo;, act as one. As Powazek wrote in a tweet, &amp;ldquo;Real journalists don&amp;rsquo;t buy stolen property.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>For many Apple fans (me included) that were anxiously waiting for both products, this is a good and slight bad news. Good news, iPhone is on track and it will be delivered as promised. Slight bad news, we will have to wait a bit longer for the Big Cat to come out.
 Apple - Hot News &amp;ndash; iPhone has already passed several of its required certification tests and is on schedule to ship in late June as planned.</description>

      <title>Wired News: Apple&#39;s iPhone is Calling</title>

      <description>Wired News: Apple&amp;rsquo;s iPhone is Calling
 The most likely scenario, as Jupiter analyst Ian Fogg has pointed out, is that the iPhone will be a stand-alone device that will accept a standard SIM card. You&amp;rsquo;ll pop the SIM card out of your current cell phone and plug it into the iPhone. It&amp;rsquo;ll be just like buying an unlocked handset from Asia, except you&amp;rsquo;ll buy it at an Apple store instead of on Craigslist.</description>

      <title>Got a Mac, once again</title>

      <description>My first knowledge about Mac&amp;rsquo;s came sorrounded by a mist of legend, legend that has lived until today: Mac&amp;rsquo;s are wonderful, powerful, friendly machines, that boot with a graphic interface and which mouse has only one big button. Ok, that was what I thought 15 years ago or so, but you get the idea.
Eight months ago I bought a dual 1.42 Ghz PowerMac G4, with 2GB RAM, 128 VRAM, 120GB HD, SuperDrive, Bluetooth&amp;hellip; beautiful machine.</description>
