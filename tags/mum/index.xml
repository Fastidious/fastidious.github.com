      <description>She created me, all my flaws and gifts unintended. She nurtured and guided me through life the best she could, suffering for my mistakes &amp;mdash;but always hopeful&amp;mdash; and rejoicing on my victories. Always supportive she gave herself to me (and my siblings), selflessly.
After a lifetime mission, her time around here has expired. We knew it would come, but never fully prepared for it. And so we wept, sadness seeping through us.</description>

      <description>My parents are visiting. They got here July 3rd and on July 4th dad was telling me they needed to leave the coming Friday. My old people are really something, but that is not what I wanted to post about.
My father talks, continuously, a lot. He will start with a simple answer to a question I asked and go on into various topics and anecdotes that seem not to have an end.</description>
