      <description>I am not happy with Sprint, I think it is a bad company. That, of course, is my opinion.
I left them and took the hit of the early termination fee (ETF) because their service in my area was, and is, not usable. Even though I had documented the many times I called for not having reception, not able to make calls, and their “unlimited” data plan been unusable, I paid the ETF and decided to move on.</description>
