      <description>No long ago I wrote that I loathed Emoji. My main grumble was their usage abuse, and, especially, the overuse of &amp;ldquo;smilies.&amp;rdquo;
Since Apple&amp;rsquo;s iOS 10, I have been warming up to them, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I came across Mu-An that they really started to captivate me. She uses them, sparingly, but with such taste! A few of her repositories exclusively deal with Emoji as well. Thus, this post is to correct myself: I don&amp;rsquo;t loathe Emoji.</description>

      <description>I despise Emoji and emoticons, specially graphical emoji, or people who continuously abuse them, and interject them in every single sentence they type, sometimes even more than once. I thought that I hated &amp;ldquo;LOL,&amp;rdquo; which I do, but I would rather see LOL &amp;mdash; when justified, not the moronic &amp;ldquo;LOL&amp;rdquo; without reason you see often &amp;mdash; than see the utter idiotic smiles, winks, etc., continuously, all the time. &amp;ldquo;I am an elitist asshole, but here, have an Emoji!</description>
