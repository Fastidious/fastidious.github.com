      <description>In the last five days I have been in Tampa four times, twice by myself and twice with Kim and KM. One may say it is only 90 miles each way, not a biggie, but once it is done several times consecutively it does makes a difference.
Three days ago we thought we had the perfect apartment there but this morning Kim thought otherwise and, as quite often, she was right.</description>
