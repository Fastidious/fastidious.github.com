      <description>This article sounds very true, although I would not go as far as generalizing it for all Americans.
 Mothers must devote themselves to their children above anyone or anything else, but many wives would be offended if their husbands said, “You’re pretty great, but my love for you will never hold a candle to the love I have for John Junior.”
Mothers are also holy in a way that fathers are not expected to be.</description>

      <description>For spammers &amp;ndash;and others&amp;ndash;, that is. Other than the trackback attack that a goodgroup of peopleincluding me received recently, sex related spam seems to have doubled as the year increased by one. And all comes down to this: human beings are a bunch of sex driven machines. Take it or leave it. We all like it, enjoy it and are driven to it in a multifaceted spectrum. It goes beyond the Mother Nature purpose of procreation (continuity).</description>
