      <description>Yesterday (15 October) Kent told me he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to take AP (Advanced Placement) classes next year. He also told me he might not want to be a neurological surgeon after all, and that he really doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what he will want to be, professionally. We talked more, but the rest of it has no place in here.
Amongst the many feelings I am experiencing, regret is one of them. If only my parents were alive.</description>
