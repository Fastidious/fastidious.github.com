      <description>Once again some (insert some lots of bad words here) terrorists have tried to affect the civilized world by detonating bombs and killing innocent people.

We are more united than ever. United Kingdom of England and North Ireland, all our love and support from the other side of the ocean!</description>

      <description>I have known about this since it was released to the News media, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t comment about it here. I am providing a link to the contents of the Memo (pretty small read, I assure you) as they showed on the Times Online on May 1st, 2005. Draw your conclusions. I just want to quote a few parts of it. The document itself says it all, really.
