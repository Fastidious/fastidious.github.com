      <description>I have a NAS at home, a Synology DS411J, which we use for backups, and to keep our family photos and videos. It works great, no complains here, but I am looking to keep an outside backup. A backup in the cloud, to be precise.
The choices are:
 Amazon Drive Amazon AWS S3 Google Drive Apple iCloud DropBox Microsoft OneDrive Any other?  I used to have Arqbackup, but it became unreliable, and I never liked the way it stored the files on AWS.</description>

      <description>A Drobo FW800 (four bays) is all I want for Christmas. I will settle for one without drives, just the enclosure. I will buy the drives later. Slowly. One at a time.
Please Santa. I know Christmas is far away, I am just giving you time. The device will be used mainly for family photos and videos. It is a good use, for a good device. Could you&amp;hellip; make it so?</description>
