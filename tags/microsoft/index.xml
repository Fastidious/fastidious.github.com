      <description>Microsoft launched its free (non open source), cross-platform, code editor early this year (April, 2015), at its Build Developer Conference.
I have been tempted to try it, as I read its file comparison is very nice, its intelliSense, and it&amp;rsquo;s based on the same platform as Atom, which I happen to love. Today was the day, but as you can see, it is a non-signed OS X application. Microsoft is big enough, and rich enough to afford signing their OS X applications, but they chose not to.</description>

      <description>From The Official Microsoft Blog:
 On June 19, Microsoft filed for an ex parte temporary restraining order (TRO) from the U.S. District Court for Nevada against No-IP. On June 26, the court granted our request and made Microsoft the DNS authority for the companyâ€™s 23 free No-IP domains, allowing us to identify and route all known bad traffic to the Microsoft sinkhole and classify the identified threats.
 Microsoft granted rights to take control of another business&amp;rsquo; DNS, to &amp;ldquo;identify and route&amp;rdquo; bad traffic?</description>

You will need to obtain a license key for each of your songs downloaded from MSN Music on any new computer, and you must do so before August 31, 2008.</description>

      <description>What does Microsoft do when they don&amp;rsquo;t get it their way? They cry like babies, they snitch and they try to use their mu$cle to get things their way.
 Microsoft Urges Review of Google-DoubleClick Deal &amp;ndash; Microsoft, a veteran defendant of epic antitrust battles in the United States and Europe, is urging regulators to consider scuttling Google&amp;rsquo;s plan to buy DoubleClick, an online advertising company.

      <title>Heavy Microsoft ads on Freshmeat</title>

      <description>Freshmeat is, in their own words, &amp;ldquo;the first stop for Linux users hunting for the software they need for work or play.&amp;rdquo; and it also &amp;ldquo;offers a variety of original content on technical, political, and social aspects of software and programming, written by both Freshmeat readers and Free Software luminaries.&amp;rdquo;
I have been very surprised to see, more and more, Microsoft ads on Freshmeat. All over the place. Quite often. Freshmeat lists thousands of applications, &amp;ldquo;[&amp;hellip;] preferably released under an open source license [&amp;hellip;]&amp;rdquo; .</description>

      <description>I was talking &amp;mdash;well, chatting&amp;mdash; the other day with a friend of mine and he was telling me some bad experiences he had had with a Windows Media Center upgrade. That got me talking about Windows Vista, perhaps it is because Windows Vista Ultimate comes with it, I am not sure. Anyways&amp;hellip;
I told my friend I am not installing Vista (although I have Windows Vista Ultimate &amp;mdash;the final version of Vista, no beta, no RC, but final&amp;mdash; as part of my MSDN subscription).</description>

      <description>This is the second time that I receive a Microsoft Security Bulletin and, since Microsoft uses PGP to sign their bulletins, I have decided to check their signature validity. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this has been a flaw in the past as well, since I delete those bulletins without even reading them most of the time, but in the two occassions I have checked them, they had failed to verify, since the signature is bad.</description>

      <description>Imagine my surprise when I saw the following Google Ad showing under one of my posts this morning:
[Was a screenshot of a Microsoft MSN advertisement on Google]
I guess Microsoft knows who is the best, right? I mean, the only way to see that advertising (other than serving adds on your own web space) is by searching the web using Google. I think it is funny&amp;hellip; and interesting.</description>

      <description>Next Monday (August 2nd) we are flipping the switch from the old reliable Linux based email system (Sendmail, Washington University IMAP/POP3) to a relatively newly deployed Microsoft Exchange 2003. Needless is to say that we &amp;ndash;TRC staff&amp;ndash; all have been busy wrapping things up to minimize the impact. But things &amp;ndash;bad things, unexpected things&amp;ndash; are bound to happen. It is just a matter of time.
With Exchange I say good bye to the taken-for-granted reliability, easy maintenance and trouble free email system that we had, to dive into the unknown.</description>

      <description>Yes, just like a lot of people around, we got &amp;ldquo;slammed at work.&amp;rdquo; There were several hundred of machines on Campus, I presumed, but the five we got compromised are the one&amp;rsquo;s that bothered me the most.
Out of the five, two were servers, our servers, my servers. A brand new SQL server, just a week old, more or less, was missing the hot fix. Another older one, under the control of somebody else, but still within my College was missing it too.</description>

      <description>I received an email today. While it is true that I receive 60 to 70 emails daily, this one was not trivial. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t the expected porno offer, nor a letter from Nigeria or Lagos promising riches. Is wasn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;reputable&amp;rdquo; diplomas or innocent spam passed along by a lack-of-knowledge friend neither. If was an email from Bill Gates itself. Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s right, an email from the billionaire Gates.
I have to admit that my first thought was, &amp;ldquo;It is another spam&amp;rdquo;.</description>
