      <description>Almost four years ago I bought our first Dell machine. And almost four year after, that machine died. Not a really long life.
Since we need a computer, we acquired another Dell&amp;hellip; again. This time it is a refurbished Precision 390. For the first time ever, I haven&amp;rsquo;t rebuilt that machine yet. I am using Dell&amp;rsquo;s factory install, cleaned up a bit, to remove the extra junk. I am starting to doubt my choice of both: buying Dell again and not completely wiping out the system.</description>

 The one I wanted was too expensive. The body did not come with a lens. I barely have time to take pictures. KM has monopolized our home workstation.</description>
