      <description>Having lost many photos of certain sentimental value a few years ago has made me paranoid. Ever since I lost my child&amp;rsquo;s first four years of photographic memory I have kept copies of our family photos and videos in two different places. I keep a copy of photos and videos in our Synology NAS at home, which backup photos to Amazon S3 and videos to Glacier.
When Apple announced their iCloud plans, and the ability to keep my entire photo library on the cloud, I was one of the first to sign up.</description>

      <description>When Apple announced the iCloud Drive integration in Yosemite, I got really excited. As I was already part of the &amp;ldquo;Apple ecosystem&amp;rdquo; (iPhone, iPad, iMac), the iCloud Drive availability in all, specially on the desktop, seemed like the culmination of all my dreams: a Cloud to rule them all. I ordered the 200 GB for $4 a month right away.
As it turns out with products in infancy, the iCloud Drive is no yet mature.</description>
