      <description>Having wished for a while to run this little site on SSL &amp;mdash;as well as having the freedom to do more things&amp;mdash; which GitHub does not allow, I have finally decided to move to a virtual server of my own. At $5 a month per droplet, DigitalOcean was the provider of choice.
DigitalOcean droplets web interface is very clean, simple, responsive and functional. Spawning the server took 54 seconds, and configuring nginx took 15 minutes, SSL included.</description>
