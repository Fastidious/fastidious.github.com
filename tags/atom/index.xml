      <description>I have been using Jekyll for a while now, but all this time I have been generating it on the server, That is, I had had a directory on the server holding the Jekyll files, in which I would run jekyll build to generate the website. Not too streamlined.
Before hosting this weblog on Vultr, I had it on GitHub, and their Pages would do the publishing for me, right after a commit, which was great.</description>

      <description>I have used many editors in the past, either under Windows or OS X. Too many, I have really lost the count. The last one I used was Sublime Text. Great editor, cross platform too, but pricey. Each time I would get the nag, I would feel guilty for not buying me a licensed copy.
I tried Atom when it first came out. It was buggy and slow, really, really slow.</description>
