      <description>My wife has always told me, &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t eat everything in your plate, leave something!&amp;rdquo; It is her believe, and her culture&amp;rsquo;s, that only poor people eats everything, and that if I do so, it will show I am dying of hunger, and thus, poor. If it were so, what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with being poor? Why will I leave food on the plate, food that I really like, to pretend what I am not?</description>

      <description>We have 36 Fahrenheit degrees this morning (2.2Â° Celsius). That is mighty cold for almost-always warm, sunny Florida. I stressed it to my child yesternight: he must wear warm clothes the next day. Reluctantly he said &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo;.
Then comes this morning, and the iMessages exchange look like this:
  Child :  &amp;ldquo;Mama is trying to make me wear an incredibly uncomfortable shirt and is yelling like a siren.&amp;rdquo;   Me :  &amp;ldquo;Why?</description>

      <title>A Christmas Tree Small Story</title>

      <description>Last year we had a plastic Christmas tree. Wife was not happy. This year she wanted a real one, so this morning the child and I went on the quest of getting it. Most families in the States will get a Christmas tree right after Thanksgiving, but I am used to get it the day before Christmas. Of course, if I wait for that day there will be none left. So it is today, or never1.</description>

      <description>After a small, but heated battle, on whether or not to buy a real tree for Christmas (Kent and I said no, Kim said yes), Kent and Alyssa are now decorating a Fraser pine tree. I am sure you guessed who won.</description>

      <description>Today, a few years ago, a wonderful person &amp;ndash;at least very wonderful to me&amp;ndash; was born. A few years later I was lucky enough to meet her and become her husband.
Today Kim reaches a new milestone and it is with love that Kent I have to say: HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM!</description>

      <title>The three of us</title>

      <description>For one reason or another, we have very few pictures on which the three of us are present. Even today, went I tried to snap one I failed. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, photos we have, but none of them pleases us &amp;ndash;Kim&amp;ndash; to put online for the viewing audience (the very small one we have here).
A couple of days ago I took one photo that I decided to put online, because I like they way KM eyes look and because it represents the priority level in our family: kid goes first, then us.</description>
