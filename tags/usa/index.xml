      <description>We bomb. From the air, from the ground, from afar, from ships. And so do the Russians now. We target what we believe are terrorists, sometimes we miss. Russians are doing the same now.
We removed Saddam, and the Taliban, just to mention two, and that created&amp;mdash;or increased&amp;mdash;a mess that continues until today. The Russian&amp;rsquo;s tactic is different, they are targeting both, the terrorists fighting against the &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; regime, and those which we are targeting as well.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands. One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.&amp;rdquo;
Happy 228th Birthday, America!
 On July 4th, 1776, we claimed our independence from Great Britain (now United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) and Democracy was born. Every day thousands leave their homeland to come to the &amp;ldquo;land of the free and the home of the brave&amp;rdquo; so they can begin their American Dream.</description>
