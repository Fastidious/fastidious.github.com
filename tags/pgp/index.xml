      <description>This is the second time that I receive a Microsoft Security Bulletin and, since Microsoft uses PGP to sign their bulletins, I have decided to check their signature validity. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this has been a flaw in the past as well, since I delete those bulletins without even reading them most of the time, but in the two occassions I have checked them, they had failed to verify, since the signature is bad.</description>

      <description>Recently PGP Corporation released their latest version of the PGP software created by Phil Zimmerman and made famous by millions of users around the world (me included). I wish I could say such latest release is great, but I can&amp;rsquo;t.
The new PGP Desktop 9.0 (or 9.0.1 beta as of this writting) come with a few new &amp;ldquo;features&amp;rdquo; and lacks of a few others that any old school PGP user might notice right away.</description>
