      <description>From the Wall Street Journal:
 North Korea said on Monday it would issue new won currency this week that would in effect lop two zeros off the old &amp;mdash;requiring 1,000-won bills, for example, to be exchanged for 10-won notes with, theoretically, the same buying power.
It said it would limit the amount of old currency it would accept in exchange, to the equivalent of about $40 worth at unofficial exchange rates.</description>

      <description>Looks like the only thing a poor country, or a country in deep economical problems, has to do to turn things around and get all major powers striving to come up with a solution &amp;mdash;which in the case I am talking about is recognition, non-aggression treaty and, most important of all, economical aid&amp;mdash; is to publicly say it is going to build a nuclear bomb or that is in the process to do it.</description>
