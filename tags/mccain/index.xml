      <description>John McCain on religion.
 &amp;ldquo;I just have to say in all candor that since this nation was founded primarily on Christian principles&amp;hellip;personally, I prefer someone who I know who has a solid grounding in my faith&amp;hellip;I think the number one issue people should make [in the] selection of the President of the United States is, &amp;lsquo;Will this person carry on in the Judeo Christian principled tradition that has made this nation the greatest experiment in the history of mankind?</description>

      <description>Bush endorses McCain in US race
 US President George W Bush has endorsed John McCain&amp;rsquo;s White House bid after the Vietnam veteran sealed the Republican nomination on Tuesday.
Mr Bush said his one-time rival would be a president with the &amp;ldquo;determination to defeat an enemy and a heart big enough to love those who hurt&amp;rdquo;.
 Now you know who not to vote for. Clear, right? Any questions?</description>
