      <description>The &amp;ldquo;paradox of the active user&amp;rdquo; is a concept introduced by John M. Carroll and Mary Beth Rosson (then at IBM, now at Penn State) to explain a common observation in several user studies done at the IBM User Interface Institute in the early 1980s (later confirmed by many other studies, including my own): Users never read manuals but start using the software immediately. They are motivated to get started and to get their immediate task done: they don&amp;rsquo;t care about the system as such and don&amp;rsquo;t want to spend time up front on getting established, set up, or going through learning packages.</description>
