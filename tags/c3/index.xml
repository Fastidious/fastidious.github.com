      <description>A while ago, I wrote about the closing of the C3 School, previously known as Parkway Preparatory School. As many other parents and staff, I was sad to see the school my kid attended to disappearing. And there were rumors, so I asked a senior Pastor (do not remember his name now) about them. I was told the Church wasn&amp;rsquo;t going anywhere, that the rumors about selling the Church were unfounded.</description>

      <description>I am sad, I am mad and I am pissed. We got a letter today from Kent&amp;rsquo;s school &amp;ndash;was Parkway Preparatory School, later changed to C3 School&amp;ndash; stating that the school is closing its doors.
 Unfortunately, our continuing analysis and review of the Church&amp;rsquo;s financial obligations has led us to the conclusion that continued operation of the school is not the best use of Church resources. Our decision is also based in part on the projected enrollment for next school year.</description>
