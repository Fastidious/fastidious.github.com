      <description>Someone decided to entice us to fill out a survey, by sending us a &amp;ldquo;lucky&amp;rdquo; two dollars bill with it. Normally we do not fill out any type of surveys, unless proper remuneration is provided. Two dollars isn&amp;rsquo;t really worth the effort, and normally would not be accepted as a fee. Yet, since there is no way to send it back with assurances it will reach the original sender, we have a small dilemma on hands.</description>
