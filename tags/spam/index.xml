      <description>A while ago I wrote about a spam I got from Nigeria (of course, we all know it could be from anywhere) and how Mr. Tanko lost his Internet connection when I asked for $20. While it is true that before and after that posting I have gotten quite a few other offers of the kind, none of them came from a man in the United Arab Emirates, supposedly. Now, that is not the unusual thing about this one.</description>

      <description>I am almost willing to bet that you know what I mean when I type &amp;ldquo;Nigerian scam&amp;rdquo;. It has been going around under different subjects, using different names and approaching the scam in a multitude of different ways. The ultimate goal is simply one: to get you bite their scam so they can get money out of you. They use some real facts to substantiate their scam.
Some of the faculty on my College has come to me to ask me to block that type of emails, but they always keep coming, from different sources.</description>
