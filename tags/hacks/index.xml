      <description>Adrian Lamo, mostly known as the hacker who broke into several major companies computer networks, and indirectly reported Chelsea Manning, has died — cause unknown thus far. The news was posted on Hacker News, of course, and I found one the comments — true or not — left there interesting.
 I had a car, while my friend did not, and Adrian had traveled via transit, so I spent the day with them hopping around town.</description>
