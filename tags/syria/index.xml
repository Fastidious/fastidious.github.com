      <description>We bomb. From the air, from the ground, from afar, from ships. And so do the Russians now. We target what we believe are terrorists, sometimes we miss. Russians are doing the same now.
We removed Saddam, and the Taliban, just to mention two, and that created&amp;mdash;or increased&amp;mdash;a mess that continues until today. The Russian&amp;rsquo;s tactic is different, they are targeting both, the terrorists fighting against the &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; regime, and those which we are targeting as well.</description>
